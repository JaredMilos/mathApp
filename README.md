# mathApp

This is a simple math facts app with basic addition, subtraction, mulitplication, and division.  Users can choose their arithmetic type and play a 10-question round.  After 10-questions, users will be able to see all of the completed problems, their answers, the correct answers, and percentage of correct responses.  While there is user account registration and login, there are currently no features within an account that aren't available outside of an account.
